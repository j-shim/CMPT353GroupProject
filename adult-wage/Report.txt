    The problem you are addressing, particularly how you refined the provided idea.
    The data that you used: how it was gathered, cleaned, etc.
    Techniques you used to analyse the data.
    Your results/findings/conclusions.
    Some appropriate visualization of your data/results.
    Limitations: problems you encountered, things you would do if you had more time, things you should have done in retrospect, etc. 
    
    
    
Problem: Predicting whether an adult's wage is over US$50k a year.

Data Used: 

- the "Adult data set" was downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult)

- Data was cleaned by 
    - removing columns that seemed redundant
    - log and rank transforming numerical features to even out their distribution
    - converting categorical features to dummy variables
    - bagging together low-count (sparse) dummy features
    - ... (add more)
    
Techniques used:
- (undersampling/oversampling)
- Naive Bayes (unsuccessful)
- MinMax scaling, then kNN
- PCA then SVM
- Neural Network
    - Gradient Boosted Tree

Results/Conclusions: 
- 86.5% validation score with gradient boosted tree.
- Comparisons of the results from using different techniques

Limitations:
- all categorical features needed to be converted to dummy variables, which often introduced too many features. This introduces sparse features, which results in overfitting. It wasn't too bad for our project.
