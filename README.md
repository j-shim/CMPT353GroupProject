# The Data Hunters

SFU CMPT 353 Data Science Group Project by Sean Nam and June Shim

#### Below is a README template adapted from https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2, To be modified later

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need Git, Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook installed on your machine

#### Cross-platform Install with [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) (Windows, macOS, Linux)

* Select Python 3.x Installer

#### Debian/Ubuntu based Linux with APT, PIP3

Open up a Terminal and type:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-dev python3-pip git
sudo apt-get build-dep python3-scipy python3-matplotlib
pip3 install scipy matplotlib bokeh pandas statsmodels scikit-learn scikit-image numexpr jupyter
```

#### macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) Package Manager

Open up a Terminal and type:

```bash
brew update
brew install python3 git
pip3 install scipy matplotlib bokeh pandas statsmodels scikit-learn scikit-image numexpr jupyter
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```bash
git clone git@csil-git1.cs.surrey.sfu.ca:jys2/the-data-hunters.git
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
